        <h2>Information Security</h2>
        <p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. We store information gathered on secure computers. The number of employees involved in the management of the data center that have physical access to these computers is limited. We use advanced security technology to prevent our computers from being accessed by unauthorized persons.

        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>Namipay collects personal information on our Sub-Merchants through the registration process, the service agreement that they execute, and various submitted documents of the Sub-Merchant's credibility as required by Namipay from time to time. We may also ask customers to supply personal data when placing an order, such as name and address, telephone number, and email address. Namipay uses this data only for the purpose of filling an order or communicating with the customer or Sub-Merchant about the status of an order. The Sub-Merchants, however, are able to collect personal information on their customers via the purchases that are made.</p>
        <p>Namipay may use the data collected in the aggregate to give us demographic information about the entire Namipay audience in order to improve the service to you and to our Sub-Merchants, to perform statistical analysis of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Sub-Merchants and visitors, to measure overall patron demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Namipay domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. We use cookies to help us determine which sites users link to, and which services Sub-Merchants and visitors use.</p>
        <p>We also track information like the domain name from which you contact us, the pages you request, the products you buy, the referring site, and the time that you spend on the site. For everyone who visits Namipay Sub-Merchant purchase page, we log IP addresses, the type of operating system that your computer uses, and the type of browser software used by you. From the IP address, we can determine the Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of your point of connectivity.</p>
